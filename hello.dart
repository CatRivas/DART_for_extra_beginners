//WELCOME TO DART (DARDO para los pinkis)
//It looks like C

//SEMICOLON: All statements in Dart end with a semicolon (;) enjoy

//INDENTATION: Dart does not require specific indentation as part of its syntax, but you know, do it because it's a good practice; it literally makes the code more READABLE


void main(){
    print('hello ðŸŒŽ');
}
