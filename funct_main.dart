//It seems that I need to work within a main() function from the start

//The main() function is where the program execution begins and, as always, it's where you can call other functions, instantiate classes, etc.

void main() {
  // Body of the main function
  
  print('DART, here I come!');
  
  regartsPets(); //calling a function
}

void regartsPets() {
  // Body of the regartsPets function
  
  print('Hello boys and girls with short legs'); //i'm referring to my dogs (they are really small)
}
